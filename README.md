# mrbeastemailtracker
App designed to allow users to track an email as it moves across the country to its destination


APPLICATION SUPPORT & INSTRUCTION
HOW TO USE:

To use the application, simply download it from the app store or google play store. Once it has been downloaded the app will show you the location of the email/package that is being sent to MrBeast. The home page that you are greeted with is the main interface that lets you zoom in.


Drivers:
The goal is to have 84 (or more) drive the package 30m each so that it can go from San diego, CA all the way across the country to Greenville, NC. Anyone can be a driver all you have to do is drive to the location that the email is currently at, pick it up, and drive it however far you want. I ask that you drop the package off at a local starbucks or chipotle so that they can keep it secure overnight.

QR CODE: On the side of the email/package their a QR code, if you scan this from within the MrBeast Email Tracker app it will allow you to take a image of which you can then post to the application. This will allow other users who are interested in driving the package to locate & see the general area that you are dropping the email off at.


Lets get this email to MrBeast!
